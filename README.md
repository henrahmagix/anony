# anony
Anonymous feedback system

## Goal
To provide a system for anonymous authors to submit issues to named recipients and receive feedback, including issue status.

The system will provide a unique login method to users through a sign-up form that requires no input.

Each item in the system will be an "issue". Each issue can be submitted to any number of named recipients at any time.

The status of an issue can be set by the author or the recipient, but the author must accept any changes to status by the recipient. For example: the recipient may mark an issue as resolved, but the author may decline this status to ensure the issue stays open until the author is satisfied.

Statuses include:
- received
- accepted
- awaiting response
- closed as actioned
- denied/closed (requires reason)

The author can make themselves known at any time and move discussion to a different medium, but is not required to do so.

Named recipients will be sent an invite to sign-up with user information (different to anonymous authors). 

## Sign-up and Login

An anonymous author will be able to ask for a random sign-in, and the system will respond with a unique ID. The author must remember or otherwise save this ID: it is the only thing that gives them access to their feedback submissions.

Alternatively, an anonymous author may author a submission and receive a unique ID upon submission, such that every issue they make may be separated.

## Storage

The storage method will be assigned when this system is deployed by the deployer(s).

This system may offer built-in methods but primarily it will be up to the initiator to attach a backend and determine it satisfies the requirements for anonymity.

## Anonymity requirements

For the chosen storage method, answer the questions below. A "yes" is üëç, a "no" is üëé. The more üëç the better.

It is up to the deployer(s) (ideally the future authors) to seek changes to produce what they would accept as an anonymous system. The questions below are provided as best practices: it is up to you to decide how many must be üëç.

- Can an issue be viewed by anyone without the author inviting them to do so?
